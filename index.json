The use of data in the screening process reduces the acquisition of soft information by traditional lenders, which harms constrained borrowers further. Additionally, groups in which fewer borrowers were financed in the past are under-represented in the data, leading to a cross-sectional difference in screening efficiency. Screening is more efficient for borrowers with greater historical lending data. When traditional and technological lenders coexist, the borrowers about whom data can provide precise information raise funds from technological lenders while those with less informative historical data choose traditional lenders who can make up for the lack of hard data-based information by acquiring soft information. The intermediation cost is increased by the existence of technological lenders. I identify conditions under which traditional lenders benefit from restricting their own access to data-processing technology when competing against the technological lender.","tags":[],"title":"Smart Lending (Job Market Paper)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario Milone","Katrin Tinn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539689407,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539689407,"objectID":"c305bc7e1fa84088904cb27e5df81218","permalink":"http://mariomilone.org/publication/transit-rents/","publishdate":"2018-10-16T12:30:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/transit-rents/","section":"publication","summary":"Trading frictions due to inevitable transportation costs are fundamentally different from those due to rent extraction by transit countries. We propose a theoretical and empirical methodology to disentangle these two types of costs and assess the presence and global magnitude of a hold-up problem. We construct a new measure of distance based on a global network of the most likely trade routes. While transportation costs make all countries worse off, rent extraction benefits transit countries. Further, we show that in general equilibrium, countries that are neither landlocked nor transit countries bear a  large share of the cost of distortions due to rent extraction. While free trade agreements with transit countries do not appear to mitigate the problem, customs unions do.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing Transit Rents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario Milone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519903927,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519903927,"objectID":"4b7f440d1c3f3fdc6f0cd446bc9eb602","permalink":"http://mariomilone.org/publication/bank-assets/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T12:32:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bank-assets/","section":"publication","summary":"In addition to risky loans, banks hold risky securities that provide uncertain future liquidity. This leads them to choose an asset structure with their desired correlation between liquidity and long term asset returns. We show that liquidity management and risk management concerns lead to a trade-off that creates an inverse relationship between security holdings and aggregate asset risk. Capital requirements mitigate liquidity risk in all future states of the world, thereby reducing the cost of liquidity risk and leading banks to increase aggregate asset risk. Liquidity requirements such as the  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) affect high liquidity shock states and mitigate aggregate asset risk-taking. These results highlight the tension between capital and liquidity regulations in addressing the risk taking incentives of financial intermediaries.","tags":[],"title":"Bank asset structure and the risk-taking implications of capital and liquidity requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gilles Chemla","Mario Milone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488367927,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488367927,"objectID":"5efe4ef01b56a7df530d8920b448566c","permalink":"http://mariomilone.org/publication/hart/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T12:32:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hart/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Oliver Hart, La finance vue à travers la théorie des contrats incomplets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrien Couëtoux","Mario Milone","Olivier Teytaud"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1321097527,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1321097527,"objectID":"1d295989e7eb4306e97caab81063a24b","permalink":"http://mariomilone.org/publication/consistent-belief/","publishdate":"2011-11-12T12:32:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/consistent-belief/","section":"publication","summary":"Estimating the belief state is the main issue in games with Partial Observation. It is commonly done by heuristic methods, with no mathematical guarantee. We here focus on mathematically consistent belief state estimation methods, in the case of one-player games. We clearly separate the search algorithm (which might be e.g. alpha-beta or Monte-Carlo Tree Search) and the belief state estimation. We basically propose rejection methods and simple Monte-Carlo Markov Chain methods, with a time budget proportional to the time spent by the search algorithm on the situation at which the belief state is to be estimated; this is conveniently approximated by the number of simulations in the current node. While the approach is intended to be generic, we perform experiments on the well-known Mines game, available on most Windows and Linux distributions. Interestingly, it detects non-trivial facts, e.g. the fact that the probability of winning the game is not the same for different moves, even those with the same probability of immediate death. The rejection method, which is slow but has no parameter and which is consistent in a non-asymptotic setting, performed better than the MCMC method in spite of tuning efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Consistent Belief State Estimation, with Application to Mines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nataliya Sokolovska","Olivier Teytaud","Mario Milone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1321097527,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1321097527,"objectID":"b897fb98045a4ebd949f646c215f4e90","permalink":"http://mariomilone.org/publication/qlearning-double-pw/","publishdate":"2011-11-12T12:32:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/qlearning-double-pw/","section":"publication","summary":"Discretization of state and action spaces is a critical issue in Q-Learning.
